# sveltekit_endpoint_practice

Inspired by the [Joy of Code tutorial](https://joyofcode.xyz/sveltekit-loading-data) for creating blog to practice endpoints.

Learning objectives:

-   Experience Lucia session based auth, to compare with Supabase SSR Auth (based on JSON Web Tokens).
-   Experience Prisma ORM, vs. more SQL-based querying that I've experienced with Supabase Auth's API (using a PostgreSQL db).

## Tech stack

-   SvelteKit
-   Lucia: Authentication
-   Prisma: ORM for local SQLite database
-   Tailwind CSS
